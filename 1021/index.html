          I welcomed a sweet sugar glider couple into my life —
          「凸凸」, a curious and slightly clumsy dad,
          and 「娜美」, a gentle and caring mom with a warm heart.
          Not long after they settled in, something unexpected happened…

        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          At first, we only noticed two round little "peanuts" hiding inside Nami's pouch.
          We thought they were just tiny bumps she carried with her every day.
          But after a few days, those peanuts began to move.
          And when we finally caught a tiny glimpse inside her pouch…
          we realized they weren't peanuts at all — they were babies!
          The moment we saw those tiny faces for the very first time, we were completely amazed and filled with joy.
          What we thought were just "two little peanuts" turned out to be the sweetest surprise in our little family's story.

        <h3>The First Tiny Troublemaker🫅🏻</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          「小次郎」 was our family's very first hedgehog baby — and he arrived with maximum attitude in minimum size.
          He's a mix of shy + sneaky + selectively social. At the park, most hedgehogs would explore the grass or enjoy the sunshine… Not 小次郎.
          Sunlight? No thanks. Adventure? Absolutely not.
          His idea of a perfect outdoor trip? Crawling straight into the inside of my pants leg and refusing to come out — like a tiny spiky tenant who pays rent with stress and cuteness.
          He may be small, but he has mastered the art of: "If I hide, the world can't see me… and I can't see the world. Perfect."

        <h3>The Apple-Loving Princess👸🏻</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          「妮妮」 is the only little girl in the hedgehog family — and she knows she’s the princess.
          Her favorite thing in the world? Apples. The moment she gets a slice, she makes a tiny “shua shua shua” munching sound, as if she’s recording an ASMR eating show just for us.
          She is everyone’s precious baby… but let’s be honest — exercise is not part of her lifestyle. Running wheel? No thanks. Gym time? Never heard of her.
          When she sleeps, she loves sticking her little bum in the air, showing off that cute pink booty — the kind that makes humans lose all self-control and think: “…Can I poke it just once?”.

        <h3>The Golden-Haired Gentle Boy🪽</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          「豆豆」 is a little golden-haired hedgehog with adorable single-eyelids — a tiny handsome boy with a soft heart.
          He has the sweetest personality and never throws a tantrum, not even once. Even when he’s sick, he takes his medicine like a perfect little angel, cooperating without complaint, as if he doesn’t want to worry us.
          He’s the kind of hedgehog that makes you gently hold your breath because he feels too precious for this world. Soft, calm, and endlessly gentle — 「豆豆」 is truly our little angel in spikes.

        <h3>The Wild Child of the Family⚡️</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          「菲比」 is the youngest of the family — a high-energy troublemaker wrapped in a tiny hedgehog body.
          He’s active, playful, and rarely ever gets mad… but holding him is like trying to hug a speeding potato with spikes.
          The moment you scoop him up, he’s already leaning forward, ready to launch into his next adventure.
          And his running wheel? Let’s just say he “decorates” it with his… creative masterpieces. No matter how many times we clean it, he’ll proudly repaint it again — as if he’s wearing muddy shoes that never wash off.
          Chaotic, messy, unstoppable — but that’s exactly what makes 「菲比」 impossible not to love.

        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          「阿捏」 is both obedient and not obedient — she listens only when she feels like it.
          Whenever we go out, she suddenly becomes a drama queen of laziness.
          If things don't go her way, she lies flat on the ground, puts on her "I'm so innocent, don't bully me" face, and refuses to move even one paw.
          She only truly listens to my dad — the rest of us might as well be background noise.
          And when it comes to other dogs? Her standards are very high. If she doesn't like them, no amount of calling, treats, or baby talk will work.
          Stubborn, charming, and loyal on her own terms — that's our 「阿捏」, the queen of selective obedience.
